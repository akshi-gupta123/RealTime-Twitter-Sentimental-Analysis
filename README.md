# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** by collecting real-time tweets using the Twitter API, processing the data, and applying various Machine Learning classifiers to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features
- **Real-time tweet extraction** using Tweepy (Twitter API)
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**, including stopword removal and tokenization
- **Handling class imbalance** to improve model performance
- **Machine Learning models applied:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- **Model evaluation and comparison** to determine the best-performing classifier

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Twitter Developer Account for API access

## Usage
1. Set up Twitter API credentials in the script.
2. Run the script to fetch real-time tweets.
3. Process and clean the collected data.
4. Train and evaluate multiple ML models.
5. Compare the models and visualize results.

## Results
The trained models are compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model can be used for real-world sentiment classification.
